In this project, I set out to analyze historical data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) to uncover meaningful insights about teams, players, and match outcomes. The IPL is one of the most followed sporting events in the world, and I wanted to use data analytics to better understand its patterns, trends, and key performers. To achieve this, I worked with ball by ball data as well as match level datasets, applying Python libraries such as Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

My first step was to clean and merge the datasets so I could create a single source of truth for analysis. Once that was ready, I began exploring different aspects of the game. I looked at toss outcomes and their influence on match results, identifying whether winning the toss had a significant advantage. I also analyzed matches where teams won the toss but ended up losing, which highlighted that strategy and execution matter more than the coin flip.

On the batting side, I explored the players with the highest overall runs, the best single match performances, and the consistency of top scorers across seasons. This gave me insights into how some players dominate not only in a single season but across multiple years. Similarly, on the bowling front, I identified bowlers with the most wickets overall, the best bowling figures in a single match, and those who consistently bowled maiden overs. These statistics showcased the bowlers who had the greatest impact in turning games around.

Fielding is often overlooked in T20 cricket, so I also studied dismissals by catches and identified the players most frequently dismissed in this manner as well as the fielders contributing the most. Additionally, I examined extras conceded by bowlers, which revealed how discipline can make a difference in close matches.

Beyond players, I analyzed umpiring trends, including the number of matches officiated by top umpires across seasons. I also studied the frequency of Duckworth Lewis (DL) affected matches and normal results across seasons to see how external factors like weather shaped the tournament.

By combining all these perspectives, I was able to build a holistic view of IPL history. This project not only strengthened my technical skills in data analytics and visualization but also gave me the satisfaction of connecting statistical findings with real cricketing insights. It showed me how data can tell stories that go beyond numbers and bring new appreciation for the sport I enjoy.
